## Usage

1. **Run the executable**  
   (Double-click or run `./french-otp` from your terminal)

2. **Set a master password**  
   (on first run, or if `otps.bin` does not exist)

3. **Add your OTP accounts**  
   (base32 key, e.g., `GVLVAZCC...`)

4. **Display and scan your real-time OTP codes**  
   - List view: OTP, account name, seconds left
   - QR code ASCII view, compatible with Google Auth, FreeOTP, Aegis, etc.
   - **QR code also shown in a separate pop-up console window for easy scanning**

5. **Remove/add accounts whenever you want**

## Example Usage

```shell
Master password: ********
== Registered accounts ==
[1] test | OTP: 489242 | 52s left

[a] Add account [s] Delete account [m] Mastercodes [q] Quit
